## 500px Client Application

This application is a demonstration for 500px client. 

Application is designed on MVP architecture. Code structure is based on [my template project](https://github.com/ilkayaktas/ProjectVelodrome). The grid view is a [Greedo library](https://github.com/500px/greedo-layout-for-android) from 500px which respect photos aspect ratios. The secret key is intentionally left in GitHub. If you fork this project, I strongly suggest to replace *secret.properties* file.
