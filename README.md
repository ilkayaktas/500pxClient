#### **500px Client Application**

This application is a demonstration for 500px client. 

Application is designed on MVP architecture. Code structure is based on [my template project](https://github.com/ilkayaktas/ProjectVelodrome). The grid view is a special library from 500px which enables photos for best fit. The secret key is intentionally left in GitHub. If you fork this project, I strongly suggest replace *secret.properties* file.
